## Writeups

These writeups document focused security investigations and exercises rewritten in a SOC-style format.  
Each entry emphasizes evidence, analysis, findings, and actionable takeaways rather than step-by-step lab instructions.

## Writeup Format

Each writeup follows a consistent structure so reviewers can quickly understand the work:

- Scenario or objective
- Environment and tools used
- Evidence collected (screenshots, logs, pcaps)
- Analysis and findings
- Detection, mitigation, or prevention notes
- Key takeaway relevant to SOC work

Some writeups are adapted from structured lab exercises and rewritten to reflect real-world analyst documentation.
