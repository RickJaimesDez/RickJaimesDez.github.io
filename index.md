# Ricky Jaimes
## Cybersecurity Portfolio

SOC-focused labs, writeups, and projects that show how I think during investigation and triage.

---

## About Me
I am working toward an entry-level SOC Analyst role. My focus is on practical skills such as alert triage, log analysis, network traffic inspection, and clear documentation.

This portfolio is built to show how I approach problems, not just which tools I have used.

## Featured Projects

### Real-Time NIDS Dashboard
**Focus:** Detection and alerting  
Built a Flask-based dashboard that displays real-time intrusion alerts with timestamps and severity levels.

- Repo: [nids-dashboard](https://github.com/RickJaimesDez/nids-dashboard)
- Writeup: [README](https://github.com/RickJaimesDez/nids-dashboard/blob/main/README.md)

**What I learned:** I improved how I turn raw alerts into clear, structured notes that explain what happened and what to do next.

---

### Wireshark Traffic Analysis
**Focus:** Network investigation  
Analyzed packet captures to identify suspicious traffic and documented findings with prevention recommendations.

- Repo: [wireshark-triage](https://github.com/RickJaimesDez/wireshark-triage)
- Writeup: [README](https://github.com/RickJaimesDez/wireshark-triage/blob/main/README.md)

**What I learned:** I got more comfortable spotting patterns in traffic and explaining them in a way that supports triage decisions.

---

### Incident Response Mini Report
**Focus:** Documentation and analysis  
Documented a lab in the format of an incident report including scope, evidence, findings, and mitigation steps.

- Repo: [incident-response-mini-report](https://github.com/RickJaimesDez/incident-response-mini-report)
- Writeup: [README](https://github.com/RickJaimesDez/incident-response-mini-report/blob/main/README.md)

**What I learned:** I practiced writing evidence-based findings and realistic mitigation steps instead of generic recommendations.
