# Ricky Jaimes
### Cybersecurity Portfolio

SOC-focused labs, writeups, and projects that show how I think during investigation and triage.

---

## About Me
I am working toward an entry-level SOC Analyst role. My focus is on practical skills such as alert triage, log analysis, network traffic inspection, and clear documentation.

This portfolio is built to show how I approach problems, not just which tools I have used.
